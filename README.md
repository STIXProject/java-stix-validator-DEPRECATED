# Java STIX Validator (BETA)
A Java library for validating STIX documents with a simple JavaFX frontend.

## Dependencies
Because the Java STIX Validator uses JavaFX, you'll need Java 7 in order to run it. There are no other dependencies.

## Use
If you're not interested in building the code manually and just want to get the validator, you can download a pre-build
JAR that will run on Windows, Mac, and Linux. The latest version is available [here](https://github.com/STIXProject/java-stix-validator/wiki/STIX_Validator.jar).

For help getting started and understanding what the validator checks for, see the [wiki](https://github.com/STIXProject/java-stix-validator/wiki).

## Development
If you want to develop against the Java STIX Validator, simply import the code into your IDE as a JavaFX application. The
`src` folder should be added as a source folder and the `resources` folder as a resources folder.

The main class for the UI is org.mitre.stix.validator.ui.Main.

## Terms
BY USING THE STIX DOCUMENT VALIDATOR, YOU SIGNIFY YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THE
TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF USE.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, DO NOT USE
